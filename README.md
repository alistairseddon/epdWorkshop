# epdWorkshop
Files and code for the EPD workshop.

The presentation was made using RMarkdown. The code for this is in the 'presentation.Rmd' file, which you should be able to open in RStudio and then build the presentation using the 'knitr' button on the RStudio window. Alternatively, there is an 'presentation.html' version which you should be able to open in an internet browser such as Chrome or Firefox. You will need to go to line 16 of the .rmd file and change the working directory to the location of the epdWorkshop_dir on your home computer.

What we wanted to stress in the workshop is that the packages (e.g. neotomaR or EPDr) are great for most standard applications, but often only get you so far and often we have needed to customise them. We wanted to show you how you could write your own functions for whatever you wanted to do with using the EPD.
